Timberwolf's Stations
=====================

A British-style station set with three different eras of
modular platforms, a small selection of station buildings
and custom waypoints based on British signal boxes.

All sprites are available in 2x zoom to match the other
Timberwolfean sets.

Getting Started
---------------

Platforms and concourses are organised by surface type.
There are 3 included by default:

* Wooden (available in any year)
* Concrete (available from 1860)
* Modern (available from 1970)

Some platform structures are not introduced until later
years. Once a platform, building or structure is available
it can be built indefinitely - this is so you can
"refurbish" your old stations or "move" your historic 
signal boxes long after their build date.

Halls, Concourses and Buffer Stops
----------------------------------

Unlike most station NewGRFs, the large station hall
will automatically attempt to determine the correct
combination of large and small roof structures. You
can build different station halls by building
platforms 1 (or 2) at a time, or building the station
in several sections of different length.

A couple of decorative concourses are also offered,
these can be used to link platforms or extend a station.
As you build a concourse the fences around the edge
will automatically adapt.

Buffer stops are also configured automatically.
When you place a buffer stop, it will have track 
connections at both ends. Start building track or
station tiles in the chosen direction and the buffer
stop will automatically configure itself. (Note that
tracks must still match the direction of the buffer
stop, 3 and 4-way buffer stops on a single tile
are not supported)

Single-sided Platforms
----------------------

Using a combination of the single-sided "inner" and
"outer" platforms it is possible to build island
stations, outer platforms and small single-platform
halts. This is cosmetic only; it has no gameplay
effect.
